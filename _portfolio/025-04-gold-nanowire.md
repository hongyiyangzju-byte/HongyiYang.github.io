This project explores the potential of gold atomic chains as quantum light sources. By combining computational physics with quantum optics theory, we aim to understand the inelastic electron tunneling mechanisms that lead to photon emission.

### Key Contributions
* **Device Modeling:** Constructed a complex device model featuring 3D electrodes and 1D gold nanowires using **Python** and the **NEGF (Non-Equilibrium Green's Function)** formalism.
* **Tunneling Physics:** Investigated the Inelastic Electron Tunneling Spectroscopy (IETS) process based on the Self-Consistent Born Approximation (**SCBA**).
* **Validation:** Calculated the **Fano factor** to characterize single-electron transport, successfully validating the resonance tunneling model for quantum light emission.

### Tools Used
* Python (NumPy, SciPy)
* NEGF Formalism
* COMSOL / Lumerical (if applicable for optical modes)
